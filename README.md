# Unity-Game-Development
Here are my game development history!

### List of the game i made in past 1.5year

## Chambble - Gamejam LubJam 2025 Game
Jam Theme - Bubble
I made an endless runner game, but in 2D. 
Due to a slight delay, I made the game myself, which is why there is no music in it, but I made all the graphics by myself except the background and main menu posters. 
The game is in a pixelart style. Several functionalities were added that were supposed to make my game stand out. 
The main character is a hamster who, tries to get as far as possible by jumping from one bubble to another, collecting carrots, which, if given the right amount,
allow him to create a rescue bubble underneath him. The player is prevented from getting as far as possible by a smoking pipe that shoots 5 bubbles at the player, a broken pipe that can cause the player to fall down, 
a fan that moves the bubble up and down, a burning kitchen element that kills the player, and flying needles that are the most dangerous for the player. A unique and annoying feature of the game is that the 
needle can bounce off the bubble and hit the player and kill them.

## Snake - First Project
My first game made, the classic and reliable Snake, it all started here, this game was part of a university project in my first year.

## FruitNinja - Clone on PC
My first tutorial on YouTube. I liked this idea and thought I'd give it a try. The tutorial ends with a simple game mode where you cut fruit and you might cut the bomb and you lose. After completing the basic tutorial, I managed to add the fruit ninja 
Arcade mode features such as slowTime banana, doublePoints banana and increasedFruitsSpawn banana. The code is a mess, but it's my beginner's mess.

### Next 3 games was made as a part of udemy course
## GalaxyShooter - 2D spaceShooter with Powerups
Simple old style 2D space shooter where you move left-right and shoot to enemies who coming from the top of the screen. Additional feature is 3 different power ups (shield, speed Boost and triple shoot). 
Project include some basic UI, effects, audio and postproccesing.

## Fleca - Cinematrography project
In this project its all about cinemachine. Game containts several more or less complex cutscenes for every moment at the game(first cutscene getting into bank, explainng the rules, win and loose and more). 
It also covers basic AI movement, win/loose condition, diffrent type of movement rather than besic WSAD and also interactions with game world.

## Dungeon Escape -2D RPG platformer
2D tilemap created world in the atmosphere of caves. Game covers basic platformer movement to jump between them to kill some enemies to get currency for better gear in merchant. I created 3 types of 
enemies(basic skeleton, moss giant and toxic spider fires toxic blast). Interactive HUD and some android game basics.

## Obstacler - Basic obstacle dodge
First Unity6 project, mini project to get used to Unity6, player try to not get hit by spinning, falling, shooting obstales when traying to get to the finish line.

## Rocketer - FlappyBird in space
Rocket flappy bird with moving obstacles and moon like gravity. It's pretty basic projects covering input actions, basic sound, particle system and more.

## ArgonAssault - SpaceShips timeline shooter
Diffrent type of project beacuse whole projetct was made with timeline and player mission is to shoot enemies through timeline events and listen the story. Environment was made with terrain tools in Unity.

## Runaway King- Endless runner game
The core mechanics are procedurally generated level with hazardsl, which include benches, carts, rocks, and more. The player must avoid this and get to the checkpoint thanks to the collectable powerups.

## Quornk - 3D Sharp Shooter, Queke style
Idea behind this project is to make fast action FPS like Quake but the game loop is based on kill all enemies and thier portals. Game contains diffrent types of weapons, pickups also whole ammo system etc. It covers
lot of core FPS mechanics so hope you like it. Game arena was made in unity probuilder.

## Wheelbarrower - Basic tower defence game
Type of simple game i want to make from the beginning. Tower Defense game. We all knew rules of these games, its a 2D project so its more like a baby of Bloons TD.

## Wheelbarrower2 - Extended version of tower defence
An upgrated version of game above, upgrade relies on dynamic path finding from enemies. The have they started path to castle, but if you place tower on thier path thier changed it to new so still can attack the castle.

## Dilec - TopDown RPG, diablo/Baldur's Gate style
A little bit bigger project with core mechanic similar to etc. Diablo. Top down camera with point click movement. Beside basic mechanic like this type of movement or enemy navmesh movement game include ciematicShoot 
to show the game, saving system, diffrent types of weapons, abilities and whole character stats system. At the end with good polish. Worth to mention, its just  a sceleton of whole game, so sandbox level, not really balanced but it comes with another part of this project

## Dilec - TopDown RPG, diablo/Baldur's Gate style version 2.0
A new, improved version of this game. Apart from a slight improvement of the previous part, what new features can be found here?
Several levels of play, an expanded save system, shop support, skills, equipment system, dialogues and challenges. Obvious improvement of the overall game with post-processing and much more to make it an RPG game

## Queen's Shadow - More complex 2D RPG
Definitely one of the most complex project i have made. Compare to previos 2D RPG platformer is on whole different level. This game covers things like:
->State Machine for both player and enemies, 
->Tilemap level,
->Parallax background,
->Complex attack system with parry,
->A big skill tree with a lot of diffrent abilities with also special atack, 
->Stat system,
->Items and inventory with thier own adding stats,
->Elemental aliments,
->Save system with checkpoints,
->Currency system,
->Crafting system,
->Diffrent types of weapons with thier own special behavior,
->5 types of unique enemies and one BOSS
and more i probably forgot to mention it here.
BIG thanks to AlexDev who came up with this course on udemy and i can do it by myself and when get stuck come here for help.

## Survival - 3D Top-Down Action-Shooter
Another bigger project, this time it a TopDown robotic shooter, while game was made from scratch so things like setup new input system and its whole behavior was made without any template etc. All arm, gun positioning, 
rag doll was made all by myself. Game covers also thing like:
->Arleady mention setup of new input system,
->Gun visuals and animations(mixamo),
->Whole weapon system with diffrent type of shooting, like single bullet, multi-shot, series,
->ObjectPool
->Interactive pickups
->Diffrent types of enemies, melee and thier variants, range also with variants and 2 types of bosses with thier own abilities,
->Procedular Level Generator
->Mission/Quest system
->Cars
and even more!.

## Steampunk Tower Defence
A unique version of the tower defense game. What makes this game unique? So:
Free user camera, unique visual effects for each tower that fit the steampunk style, custom tower types like a drone machine or a fan. yes, a fan, everything makes sense for any style of play. With unique towers of course comes unique enemies like a flying ship that drops tons of small enemies, a giant spider that can disable your towers and more. I think that in the field of these games this one have at least one thing that stood out form the other.

## RDG - Random Dungeon Generator
The most difficult project from this period. 
The difficulty of this project was that for this purpose I created my own custom unity window, which allowed me to create my own type of graph (Room Node Graph), 
on the basis of which dungeons were later created. This entire process is carried out with a large number of validations to ensure that the created dungeon does not overlap or 
follows the created rules, e.g. that given rooms can only be connected through a corridor. To fully understand what's going on there, it's best to delve into the scripts.

## Rouglike gunner - Pistoll Issac
Continuation of the RDG project, apart from the previous generation of dungeons, there are also mechanics known from a game like Isaac, only with weapons in hand. The game provides numerous rooms full of enemies, rooms with bosses, or rooms with rewards. The game provides several interesting visual effects that serve as projectiles of enemies for example. The player has several interesting types of weapons to choose from and more. It all adds up to a more complex, large project
