# Unity-Game-Development
Here are my game development history!

### List of the game i made in past 1.5year

## Chambble - Gamejam LubJam 2025 Game
Jam Theme - Bubble
I made an endless runner game, but in 2D. 
Due to a slight delay, I made the game myself, which is why there is no music in it, but I made all the graphics by myself except the background and main menu posters. 
The game is in a pixelart style. Several functionalities were added that were supposed to make my game stand out. 
The main character is a hamster who, tries to get as far as possible by jumping from one bubble to another, collecting carrots, which, if given the right amount,
allow him to create a rescue bubble underneath him. The player is prevented from getting as far as possible by a smoking pipe that shoots 5 bubbles at the player, a broken pipe that can cause the player to fall down, 
a fan that moves the bubble up and down, a burning kitchen element that kills the player, and flying needles that are the most dangerous for the player. A unique and annoying feature of the game is that the 
needle can bounce off the bubble and hit the player and kill them.

## Snake - First Project
My first game made, the classic and reliable Snake, it all started here, this game was part of a university project in my first year.

## FruitNinja - Clone on PC
My first tutorial on YouTube. I liked this idea and thought I'd give it a try. The tutorial ends with a simple game mode where you cut fruit and you might cut the bomb and you lose. After completing the basic tutorial, I managed to add the fruit ninja 
Arcade mode features such as slowTime banana, doublePoints banana and increasedFruitsSpawn banana. The code is a mess, but it's my beginner's mess.
